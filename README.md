2. [Development Model](#development-model)

## Getting Started

Put dispatcher.js as generated by `npm run build:global-init` under ui/ui/js/

JVM service files end up under ui/ui/js/jvm-service/

## Development Model

The project uses the [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) development model. The `master` branch should always be the current stable version. Keep development in the `develop` and feature branches.

The current development version always end in -SNAPSHOT.

When naming feature branches, prefix the name with ui- if it pertains to the UI, core- otherwise (e.g. ui-registration and core-registration).
