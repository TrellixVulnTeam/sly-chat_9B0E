Requirements:
    General:
        - python3: for build scripts
        - patch
        - bash
        - autotools: for building sqlcipher
        - groovy (build.conf:groovy-home): required to run gant
        - gant (build.conf:gant-home): required to build sqlite4java
        - swig (for sqlite4java)

    For OSX builds:
        - Mac OS X Oracle JDK (build.conf:osx-jdk-home)
        - OSXCross (https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross) (bin dir must be added to PATH)

    For Windows builds:
        - Windows (64bit) Oracle JDK (build.conf:win32-jdk-home)
        - Mingw w64 cross compiler (mingw-w64-gcc in arch)

    For android builds:
        - Android NDK
        - Android SDK

Build directory layout:
    build/: unpackaged source dir used during builds
        <platform>/
    output/: copied sqlite4java libraries from root/ after successful builds
    root/: used as prefix when building src under build/
        <platform>/
    src/: source tarballs
        <platform>/
